# Development Environment Setup Kit

Free configuration files and documentation to effectively setup a documented Development Environment understandable by all members of a team of programmers.

The Development Environment Setup kit consists of the following installation and setup guides:

### Setup guides

* [JDK installation and configuration guide](jdk/jdk-setup-guide.md) 
* [Eclipse IDE installation and configuration guide](eclipse/eclipse-setup-guide.md)

### Usage guides

* [Eclipse Shortcut guide](eclipse/eclipse-shortcuts.md)

## Why use our guides
While replicating an installation of development may seem relatively easy (as easy as copying the Eclipse installation directory to another machine), **replicating the configurations** by all members of a development team is not a simple task. 

Therefore, the Development Environment Configuration kit aims at:

* Documenting a reference configuration for tools that can be shared and replicated within a team of programmers
* Serving as a guide to for diagnosing problems in the configuration of tools 
* Serve as a repository of knowledge and best-practices
* Improving code quality by sharing best practices among all programmers

## How to contribute
If you have an idea for a guide, suggestions for enhancement or have identified a problem in one of our Environment Setup and Configuration guides we are happy to receive your contributions.

Please make sure you:

* Have used and understand how the Environment Setup Kit is organised (each directory corresponds to a guide)
* Have read the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

Thank you for considering helping the improvement of the Development Environment Setup Kit.
